- **Phone Number Validation**: Validates that the phone number consists of 10 digits.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays error messages next to the relevant field if the user input is invalid.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the form.
- **CSS**: Used to style the form and provide feedback.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle form validation logic.
